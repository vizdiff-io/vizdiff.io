import { createHash } from "crypto"

/**
 * Canonical S3/MinIO object-key layout, shared by every writer and prefix-computation site
 * (api upload, worker screenshot/diff upload, retention reaper, project/account deletion).
 *
 * Keys carry a two-level `/ab/cd/` hash fanout derived from the project id:
 *
 *   projects/<ab>/<cd>/<projectId>/screenshots/<uploadId>/<storyId>.png
 *   projects/<ab>/<cd>/<projectId>/<uploadId>.tar.gz
 *
 * S3 partitions its index by leading key bytes and rate-limits per partitioned prefix
 * (~3,500 PUT/s). Sequential project ids (and time-ordered UUIDv7 upload ids) would otherwise
 * concentrate all new writes on the rightmost partition; hashing the project segment spreads
 * concurrent projects uniformly across 65,536 buckets so partition splits distribute load.
 * The fanout sits *before* the project id — not at the very front of the key — so that
 * delete-by-prefix still works at every granularity used by the app: per upload
 * ({@link screenshotsKeyPrefix}), per project and per account ({@link projectKeyPrefix}),
 * all computable from ids alone.
 *
 * Within a single project, upload ids are UUIDv7 (time-ordered), capping one project at
 * roughly a single partition's write rate. That is a deliberate trade-off; an inner fanout
 * can be added if a single project ever needs more.
 *
 * TestResult image columns store the full object key, so readers (presigning) never
 * recompute paths from ids — only writers and deleters must agree with this module.
