/**
 * Browser safeguards for rendering untrusted Storybook bundles (issue #69).
 *
 * User uploads contain arbitrary HTML/CSS/JS that we execute in a headless
 * Chrome instance. This module hardens that execution against exfiltration and
 * abuse via two complementary layers:
 *
 *  1. Chrome launch flags ({@link hardenedChromeArgs}) that disable risky
 *     platform features (WebRTC, background networking, etc.) at the browser
 *     level. These are applied via `goog:chromeOptions.args` and cannot be
 *     undone by page script.
 *
 *  2. A page-level init script ({@link safeguardInitScript}) installed before
 *     any story code runs. It neutralizes real-time transports and off-origin
 *     `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest`/`sendBeacon` and `window.open` at the JS layer.
 *     Transport globals are redefined non-configurably so page scripts cannot
 *     restore them.
 *
 *  3. A WebDriver BiDi network interceptor ({@link installNetworkEgressBlock})
 *     that fails every off-origin request (sub-resource, navigation, fetch,
 *     XHR, WebSocket, beacon) at the network layer. This is the hard boundary:
 *     page script cannot undo it, so no data can leave the same-origin static
 *     server regardless of how the bundle tries.
 *
 * Defense-in-depth note: the init script (layer 2) runs inside the page and is
 * not a hard boundary on its own — a sufficiently adversarial bundle could
 * capture references before our script runs, and some native methods (notably
 * `location.assign`/`replace`, which are non-configurable own properties in
 * Chrome) cannot be reliably overridden from page JS at all. Layer 3 (the BiDi
 * network interceptor) is therefore the authoritative egress control; the init
 * script is a fast-failing convenience layer that gives clean errors to the
 * page. Both depend on WebDriver BiDi (`webSocketUrl: true`).

/**
 * Page init-script source, evaluated in the page context before any story
 * script runs. It is intentionally written as a self-contained function with no
 * external references so it can be serialized via `addInitScript`.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *  - Blocks `window.open` to non-same-origin URLs (same-origin == the local
 *    static server).
 *  - Disables real-time transports entirely: WebSocket, WebTransport, RTCPeer-
 *    Connection, EventSource. These globals are redefined non-configurably so a
 *    later page script (e.g. MSW's WebSocket interceptor) cannot restore them.
 *  - Blocks off-origin `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest`; same-origin requests pass
 *    through unchanged so legitimate Storybook assets still load.
 *
 * Note: off-origin top-level navigation via `location.assign`/`replace` is NOT
 * handled here. Those are non-configurable own properties of `Location` in
 * Chrome and cannot be overridden from page JS; off-origin navigation egress is
 * instead blocked by {@link installNetworkEgressBlock} at the network layer.
